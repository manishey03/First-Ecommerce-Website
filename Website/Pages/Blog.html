              Many studies have suggested that interacting with plants helps humans have a relaxed mind. Interaction with a bonsai can help in lowering blood pressure and reducing the vibes of psychological stress. It is also believed that when you interact with your plant, it grows well.

              <h4>About Technology</h4>
              <p>It has been around for well over a thousand years. The ultimate goal of growing a Bonsai is to create a miniaturized but realistic representation of nature in the form of a tree. Bonsai are not genetically dwarfed plants, in fact, any tree species can be used to grow one.</p>
           <h4>What is a Bonsai tree exactly?</h4>
           <p>
              Techniques such as pinching buds, pruning and wiring branches, and carefully restricting but not abandoning fertilizers are used to limit and redirect healthy growth. Most commonly kept under four feet (or about a meter) in height, Bonsai are not genetically dwarfed plants. However, plants with smaller leaves do make these compositions easier to design. In fact, any plant species that has a woody stem or trunk, grows true branches, can be successfully grown in a container to restrict its roots/food storage capability, and has smaller or reducible-leaves can be used to create a Bonsai.

             <h4>Positive aspect</h4>
             <p>Bonsai plants are popular all around the globe for a variety of reasons.
               Because of the benefits of bonsai, the practice of cultivating them has grown steadily since their introduction. The Japanese method of cultivating miniature copies of large trees is so adorable that it has given rise to a whole new plant business. 
               Despite the fact that cultivating bonsai is a time-consuming process, individuals are willing to invest in them.

             <h4>Negative aspect</h4>
             <p>The major disadvantages of bonsai plants are that they require constant care and attention, need watering daily, can be expensive, and have been linked with increased insect infestations.
              Bonsai plants cannot be left for weeks on end by themselves when compared to other plant hobbies. 
             <br>Bonsais require a lot of work in other areas such as watering which needs to be done daily or even twice daily in some instances. 
              <br>By going into bonsai with realistic expectations that it takes some bonsai masters years if not decades of experience
              to have beautiful bonsai gardens means that you will not get frustrated when things start to get tough.
